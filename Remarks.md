On inspecting the clusters:

* cardomain-clusters: Cluster #3 seems a bit diverse.
* everyday-clusters: No complaints about the clusters.
* healthcentral-clusters: no complaints.
* health-clusters: #5 and #6 : minor visual changes exist (tab + color
  at the top). Is this desired or no?
* myrecipes-clusters: no complaints.
